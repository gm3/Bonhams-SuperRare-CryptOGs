### Proof of Work - Genesis
Hard work is not easy, but it opens the possibility for great rewards. Watching the clouds go by helps to stay grounded and in the moment... Proof of Work - Genesis, animated video, 808 x 1080. Conceived in 2018, minted in 2021. Artwork was originally tokenized as ERC-20 on R.A.R.E. ART LABS on September 26, 2018. The edition of 10 went unsold for over a year. I decided to burn all unsold tokens on October 30, 2019 when ERC-721 became the technology standard for NFT tokens. It is now being offered as a 1/1 in the original size to honor the genesis of animated artwork that draws parallels and forms fractals between computers mining for 'proof of work' cryptocurrency and gold miners panning for gold in the rivers of the California gold rush where I grew up. The present work features in “Bonhams & SuperRare: CryptOGs, The Pioneers of NFT Art, June 21st-30th 2021”, Lot 1”

### Space Loaf

Space Loaf hovers through the cosmic Ether. It’s not Here, and it’s not Then, so it makes you ask… When? Signature Digital-Analog Video Alchemy by Sarah Zucker / @thesarahshow. Created in studio in 2018 with original footage, video feedback and analog processing on VHS. Digitally transferred in 1080p and optimized at 5:4 ratio for my social media practice at that time. Single Edition .mp4. An "Artist's Reserve" Token – a masterwork from my career, created in 2018 and tokenized in 2021.

### In Touch
This is a tribute to the artist's Igbo heritage where the leopard is a symbol of strength and masquerades serve as a bridge between the ancestors and the living. The present work features in “Bonhams & SuperRare: CryptOGs, The Pioneers of NFT Art, June 21st-30th 2021”, Lot 5”

### Cybaroque Borghese
Ancient trees glitch in the virtual Valley of the Trees as Canova’s masterpiece is lit up with graffiti mask. The Cybaroque Quantum computer programme for Villa Borghese was one of the most popular downloads in 2080. She could step into the AI Baroque landscape and drape herself in front of the Villa and be transported back into her beloved Roma. Closing her eyes, she switched on the neon wire frames pulsating Italian arias all around the virtual Villa. Like the marble statue of Princess Paolina Borghese, she was forever a young and beautiful Venus in the Cybaroque Borghese Gardens."

### Spinning Circle
The theme of the circle is a thing that every now and then appears in my artistic path, and this is the first time that I've decided to experiment it in my "rubberstamp" technique and in a color combination that you don't find often in my other pieces. This is my very first animated rubberstamped piece of 2021. The whole system that I've used to create this artwork is made by me, from the stamps to the sheets and in the final stage the digitalization. One more time, from analog to digital.
